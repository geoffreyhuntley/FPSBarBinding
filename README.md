A frames per second graph that overlays the status bar. Xamarin.iOS binding of https://github.com/RolandasRazma/RRFPSBar.

View the above project for usage. Just add the library and then add FPSBarBinding.FPSBar.SharedInstance.Hidden = false; to appDelegate

We could have just re-written it quickly in C#, but this serves as a good example of binding a simple objective-c library.
